To achieve this, you can use the `gspread` library along with the `pandas` library in Python. Make sure to install these libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install gspread pandas
```

Here's a sample Python script that demonstrates how to populate a Google Sheets spreadsheet with a specified number of columns and rows using dynamic column names:

```python
import pandas as pd
import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

# Set up Google Sheets API credentials
scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('path/to/your/credentials.json', scope)
gc = gspread.authorize(credentials)

# Create a new Google Sheets spreadsheet
spreadsheet_name = "Your Spreadsheet Name"
spreadsheet = gc.create(spreadsheet_name)
worksheet = spreadsheet.sheet1

# Specify the number of columns and rows
num_columns = 5
num_rows = 10

# Generate dynamic column names (e.g., A, B, C, ...)
column_names = [chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(num_columns)]

# Create a DataFrame with random data
data = {col: [f"{col}{j}" for j in range(1, num_rows + 1)] for col in column_names}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Write the DataFrame to the Google Sheets spreadsheet
worksheet.update([df.columns.values.tolist()] + df.values.tolist())

print(f"Data has been successfully written to {spreadsheet_name}.")
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/credentials.json'` with the actual path to your Google Sheets API credentials JSON file. Also, you may need to share the spreadsheet with the email address found in the credentials file.

This script creates a new spreadsheet, generates dynamic column names, creates a Pandas DataFrame with random data, and then writes the data to the Google Sheets spreadsheet. Adjust the `num_columns` and `num_rows` variables as needed.
